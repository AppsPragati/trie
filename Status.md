I wrote this on Dec.18.2006 and thought it might be helpful to others (a search for 'trie' on
this site yielded 0 reults).  The trie itself is included along with a few other files
I've used to play/test.

Included in the trie is a method that, given a word, will try to find the best match for
that word that exists in the trie.  It determines best using edit distance and word
frequency. (this is the functionality which originally drove me to write it.)
